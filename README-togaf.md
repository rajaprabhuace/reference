# Introduction to Part II

## ADM Overview

## Architecture Development Cycle
### Basic Structure
The phases of the ADM cycle are further divided into steps; for example, the steps within the architecture development phases (B, C, D) are as follows:
* Select reference models, viewpoints, and tools
* Develop Baseline Architecture Description
* Develop Target Architecture Description
* Perform gap analysis
* Define candidate roadmap components
* Resolve impacts across the Architecture Landscape
* Conduct formal stakeholder review
* Finalize the Architecture
* Create the Architecture Definition Document

#### Phases
Architecture Vision
Business Architecture
Information Systems Architecture
Technology Architecture

### Architectural Inputs

** Scope of organizations impacted
** Maturity assessment, gaps, and resolution approach
** Roles and responsibilities for architecture team(s)
** Constraints on architecture work
** Re-use requirements
** Budget requirements
** Requests for change
** Governance and support strategy
