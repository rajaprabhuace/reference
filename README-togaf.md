# Introduction to Part II

## ADM Overview

## Architecture Development Cycle
### Basic Structure
The phases of the ADM cycle are further divided into steps; for example, the steps within the architecture development phases (B, C, D) are as follows:
* Select reference models, viewpoints, and tools
* Develop Baseline Architecture Description
* Develop Target Architecture Description
* Perform gap analysis
* Define candidate roadmap components
* Resolve impacts across the Architecture Landscape
* Conduct formal stakeholder review
* Finalize the Architecture
* Create the Architecture Definition Document

#### Phases
* Phase A: **Architecture Vision** describes the initial phase of an architecture development cycle
* Phase B: **Business Architecture** describes the development of a Business Architecture to support the agreed Architecture Vision
* Phase C: **Information Systems Architectures** describes the development of Information Systems Architectures to support the agreed Architecture Vision
* Phase D: **Technology Architecture** describes the development of the Technology Architecture to support the agreed Architecture Vision
* Phase E: **Opportunities & Solutions** conducts initial implementation planning and the identification of delivery vehicles for the architecture defined in the previous phases
* Phase F: **Migration Planning** addresses how to move from the Baseline to the Target Architectures by finalizing a detailed Implementation and Migration Plan
* Phase G: **Implementation Governance** provides an architectural oversight of the implementation
* Phase H: **Architecture Change Management** establishes procedures for managing change to the new architecture
* **Requirements Management** examines the process of managing architecture requirements throughout the ADM
